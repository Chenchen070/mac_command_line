# Command line

# Command Line Interface

## Context
- CLI predates Windows/Mac OS
- The first computers didn't have a mouse
- "What You See Is What You Get" with Graphical User Interface (GUI) - you see icons, menus
    - Good side of GUI: easy adoption, if it's in the menu, you can do the thing.
    - Downside of GUI: what you see is ALL you get.
    - Upside to CLI: the sky is the limit w/r/t functionality. 
    - Downside to CLI: it's not terribly untuitive

## What we're doing is learning to talk to your computer
- How to tell your computer what you need
- Adopt using the CLI for file/folder management tasks. 
- Anything you learn here on CLI transfers to Linux machines

## Vocabulary
- "Terminal" is an application on your Mac.
- Terminal talks to the Shell, shell executes commands  

~ means "Home directory". Your home directory is the main directory for your currently logged-in user

## Finder commands
- command key + up-arrow

# Drills
echo $SHELL
echo Hello
pwd
`open .` opens the current working directory in Finder (visually)

## Useful Things to Know
- Tab autocomplete:
    - Terminal knows it's tough to type a bunch of stuff
    - If you're typing a folder/file name and you already have the first unique characters, hit TAB and you'll experience autocomplete.
- man command_name pulls up the manual page for that command_name
If you're seeing paginated results from the terminal and cannot exit, type “q”

## File/Folder Paths
- When you type `pwd`, you get back the full (absolute) file path to where you are
- Absolute path is the full and complete file path to a folder/file.
- Absolute path starts with /
- /Users/your_username/some_folder
- Relative paths are relative to where you currently are (is pwd)
- `~` is short for your home directory, whatever your currently logged in user is.
- `cd ..` goes up a directory from your `pwd`
- `cd ../..` goes up two folders from your `pwd`

## Commands
- `mv source destination` and source could be relative or absolute and so can the destination
- Renaming a file is moving it to the same folder w/ a different name
- `rm` removes a file completely (does NOT go to the Trash). Recommend using Finder/Delete for removing files
